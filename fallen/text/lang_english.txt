You're a good cop, Darci, but you play rough.  You are injuring too many civilians in the course of your duty.
Congratulations on a successful mission, Darci, however you are responsible for an unacceptable number of civilian casualties.  Consider this your first warning.
I'm at the end of my patience, Darci.  Our job is to protect the residents of Union City.  Consider this your final warning.  One more mission with too many civilian casualties and I'll have your badge.
We can hardly afford to lose you, Darci.  However, my first duty is the protection of the citizens of Union City.  In the course of your duty, your behaviour has resulted in more civilian casualties than I am prepared to accept.  I'm taking your badge for good.
